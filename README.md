## 📘 Project Overview

This project involved the **automation of a PDC (Polarization-Depolarization Current) measurement setup** to investigate the **conductivity behavior of insulating materials** under electrical stress. The project aimed to replace manual measurement routines with a robust, **microcontroller-based system** that can precisely control voltage application, monitor environmental variables, and record electrical responses.

The result is a **fully functional, modular test platform** using Arduino microcontroller and sensors, designed to control, measure, and log current responses in test samples under polarization and depolarization conditions.

This was not just a coding or automation project — it involved deep electronics engineering:

- Created the **circuit schematic** in EasyEDA
- Designed and laid out a **custom 2-layer PCB** with labeled silkscreen and power traces
- Selected and placed **high-voltage relays, resistors, capacitors**, and **sensor headers**
- Ordered and soldered the PCB manually to integrate with Arduino microcontrollers
- Verified board functionality with multimeter, oscilloscope, and test loads
- Integrated **decoupling capacitors**, **flyback diode protections**, and **thermal cutoff**

This phase showed mastery in:
- Power electronics
- Embedded hardware design
- Analog signal conditioning
- Hardware-software integration

## 🧪 Background

PDC methods are used to evaluate **conductivity and dielectric behavior** in insulating materials like polymers or insulation oils. When a voltage is applied, polarization current is measured; after removing the voltage, depolarization current is monitored.

The setup simulates this process by:
- Applying a defined voltage using a custom high-voltage generator
- Measuring the current through the test sample
- Recording time-stamped current values using Arduino-based analog-to-digital conversion
- Stopping the process based on temperature, time, or current thresholds
